/*Binary search is an efficient approach to search a particular element from a sorted array of numbers.

You have a sorted array consisting of X elements, and you input the value to be found in it. The algorithm compares your input value with the key value of the
array's middle element. So here we have the following 3 scenarios:

1)If input key value matches the key value of the middle element, then its index is returned.
2)If input key value is lesser than the key value of middle element, then we do a search on the sub array to the left of the middle element.
3)Similarly if the input key value is greater than key value of middle element, then we do a search on the sub array to the right of the middle element.*/
